<p>Hi, I'm Sean.</p>

<p>
    My real name is Santak Kumar Mishra. I'm a Software Developer from India currently residing in the United States. My language of choice is Javascript, but, I'm also fairly proficient in PHP. I love coding and I'm really good at it. I endorse Open Source software and do my best to contribute back to the community. My journey as a developer is still in its infancy. I am fortunate to have been born as a millenial and witnessed the evolution of technology like never before. I am honored and humbled to be living among some of the greatest minds in the history of mankind and technology. I aspire to learn and grow as a successful developer in the industry and rise up to join the ranks of the elite few whose designed algorithms, languages and software I use everyday.

<p>
    I pride myself as a social geek and perhaps a leader in the community. I am ever eager to share the knowledge I gain on my journey and to bring more bright minds into the folds of the beautiful world of technology, more specifically, coding. I am also an innovator at heart and love bringing my ideas to life with the help of programming. Someday I wish to find myself in the company of talented like-minded people with whom I could do something awesome and achieve something truly remarkable.

    Apart from being a techie, I'm also a bibliophile, writer, gamer, music junkie, nature lover, fitness freak and caffeine addict.
