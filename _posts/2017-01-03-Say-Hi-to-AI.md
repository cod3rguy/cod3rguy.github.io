title: Newbie Coders, Say Hi to AI
---

The Artificial Inteligence (AI) field has advanced with significant strides in the past couple years. Let's face it - [Skynet] is inevitable and there's nothing any of us can do about it. Until then, why not take advantage of AI and see if we can strike up a friendship? <read-more>

Building projects is an essential part of learning to code. If you're looking for ideas to develop your next interesting application, make sure you don't discount AI. Now, when I think of AI, the top five names that come to mind are:-

- Amazon's [Alexa]
- Apple's [Siri]
- Google's [Assistant]
- Microsoft's [Cortana]
- IBM's [Watson]

However, only one of the above is an actual AI. Contrary to popular belief, Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google Assistant are just personal assistants with a personality. Although they do have some degree of intelligence built in, they are simply scripted applications without an actual brain. IBM's Watson, on the other hand, is a full fledged AI brain with cognitive capabilities. There are speculations of Siri becoming more advanced and maybe getting full cognitive capabilities in future, but right now it's still just an assistant. IBM currently provides the public usage of Watson for certain services over an API. Similar to IBM, Microsoft also provides a set of AI services under the name of [Microsoft Cognitive Services (MCS)]. While you can build apps using Alexa, Siri, Cortana or Google Assistant, those apps would only run on proprietory platforms to supplement and enhance the behavior of these virtual assistants. If you want to integrate AI capabilities into you own web application, you can take advantage of IBM or Microsoft's cognitive services.

If you have some basic knowledge about developing front end web applications, you probably know what APIs are and how to use one in your application. If not, [FreeCodeCamp] has a great curriculum that you should check out. By the time you get your Front End Developer Certification, you would have built some great API based applications. Once you know how to build API based applications, you're one step closer to trying your hands at some AI magic.

Watson and MCS are both unique in their capabilities. While most of the services provided by both of them are similar, I have found their performance to be slightly varying across some of these services. In some cases, Watson gives better results while in others MCS takes the trophy. There are services unique to each of them too. So, be sure to check them both out. Both of them provide a free tier for their services which should be enough for small applications. Above that, I think MCS has cheaper rates than Watson when it comes to paid tiers. Some of the interesting services that both have in common and you can take advantage of are:-

- **Image Analysis:** IBM calls it [Visual Recognition] while MCS has named thier's as [Computer Vision]. It allows you to extract useful information from an image.
- **Text Analysis:** Learn the language, tone, mood and even the personality of the writer from a block of text.
- **Speech<->Text:** Both of them provide Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech based on natural language processing. Although I have found MCS to be slightly better at speech recognition.
- **Language Translator:** Both provide a translator service with varying capabilities.
- **Information Discovery** Both can help you retieve relevant,useful and up-to-date information from around the web based on input phrases and other parameters.

I have yet to try my own hands out at building an AI application. I do have a couple ideas though which I might be testing out soon. Technology has advanced leaps and bounds since I first started coding. The AIs might not have super-human intelligence yet, but they're still very powerful. Being able to interact with them on a code level is a privilege. Make sure you'd be able to call yourself one of the firsts to interact with a real AI entity before AIs become commonplace in the future.
