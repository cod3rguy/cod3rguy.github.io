Took me a while to develop this website and get it up and running. Finally, I can start writing blog posts. Although to be honest, this website is still a work-in-progress project. I have a list of ideas to make it faster and better with cleaner code. However, I'm satisfied for now. This was my first project using [Jekyll][1] and I have to say, I didn't expect this at all. <read-more>

When I first came across Jekyll a few months ago, I thought it was just another templating engine. I didn't give it a chance at that time which I regret deeply now. For some reason, I decided to build a static personal site this time and host in off [Github][2] directly. I'm so happy I chose Jekyll for this job because now I came to know how powerful it really is. It definitely isn't your average templating engine. It's an extremely versatile static website building framework which happens to power the [Github Pages][3]. It provides a built-in blogging platform, which if set-up properly can be amazingly fast and efficient. When I started to develop this website, I decided to go for a minimalistic approach following the [KISS principle][4]. Jekyll became the perfect tool for this purpose, being lightweight and non database driven. The [Liquid][5] syntax used by it is developed and maintained by [Shopify][6] can be used to develop templates for them.

I also used [LESS][7] extensively in this project as my CSS pre-processor. Earlier I had learned [SASS][8] instead of LESS because I read somewhere that it was better. But, that's not necessarily true. Each has it's own pros and cons. It is always best to try all available options and choose the one you like. Although choosing LESS over SASS in this project cost me some compilation time which could have been avoided as **Jekyll + Github Pages** has support for SASS compilation on the fly. However, there is a catch which I'm going to discuss in my next post. It is also the reason why I chose LESS for this project.
